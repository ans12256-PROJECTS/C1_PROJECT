Subject: Dataset use suggestions (WDFW Coded Wire tag fish recoveries)

Dear WDFW,
I would like to use your dataset of WDFW Coded Wire tag fish recoveries for my student project as a data scientist.
The idea is to show ability to clean data, test statistical hypothesis, and present results at the school.
I am planning to explore data set to see if correlation with a few factors could be demonstrated, like orcas recovery, recreational fishing (licenses sold, catch records, boats sold, fishing tours operators activity), funds spent on recovery effort, Native Americans catch records, river dams profitability?
Your insights and recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

Best regards,
